# How to Word Games
Empowering individuals to take control of their mental health by providing a personal monitoring and support system.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
The bootcamp I went to had a set of problems to find anagrams, palindromes, the solutions to scrabble, etc. I was
looking for a project and thought that many people who work with words might want a site to find anagrams

## ðŸ¤” Purpose
Simple site to allow the user to enter a string of characters and find an array of words (or boolean, for palindromes) that fit their request.

## What it does
Accepts a user input as a stirng and passes it through various functions to find the requested data.
For palindromes, it's a simple reverse function. For the more complex functions, like anagrams and scrabble solver,
there's a corresponding function to test if ther esults are accurate.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design
I designed this before learning Figma. If I can find the paper notes, they'll be uploaded soon.

## ðŸ›  How we Built it
- React
- Vite
- Bootstrap

## ðŸ™Œ Insights from SelfWatch
This was my first React project. I learned component structure, pages and simple routing. Excited to see what's possible with these tools!
